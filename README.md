- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Harvey, aka @collectivenectar
- 👀 I’m interested in open source and decentralized protocols (not just blockchains, IPFS, libp2p, BT Mesh, etc)
- 🌱 I’m currently finishing up an iOS app in Godot, learning HTML/CSS/JS via 30-week bootcamp, and learning chia/lisp too for my next project
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps, games, anything that is non-violent and just helps humans to be more awesome to each other in general.
- I'm also a digital artist, musician and songwriter. See my stuff on artstation(https://www.artstation.com/jonathanharveyart) and soundcloud (@collectivenectar).
- 📫 How to reach me? Best way is either here on github or email jonathanharvey22@gmail.com, linked in at linkedin.com/in/jonathanharveydev, twitter @_jonharvey
