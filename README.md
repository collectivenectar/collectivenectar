- 👋 Hi, I’m Jonathan Harvey, aka @collectivenectar
- 👀 I’m interested in open source and decentralizing projects
- 🌱 I’m currently building an iOS app in Godot
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps, games, anything that is non-violent and just helps humans to be more awesome to each other in general.
- I'm also a digital artist, musician and songwriter. See my stuff on artstation(https://www.artstation.com/jonathanharveyart) and soundcloud (@collectivenectar).
